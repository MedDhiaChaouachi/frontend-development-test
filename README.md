# 📦 Buzzbip Frontend Development Test

## 📌 Objective

This project was developed as part of a **Frontend Development Test** using **Next.js**. The goal is to translate a Figma design into a functional, responsive, and accessible frontend interface.

The test evaluates:

- UI translation accuracy from Figma.
- Responsive behavior across devices.
- Clean, modular, and scalable code structure.
- Implementation of interactive and accessibility-friendly behaviors.

🧱 Key Decisions
-Next.js was used for file-based routing and fast dev setup.

-CSS Modules were chosen for scoped and maintainable styling.

-Component-based structure was implemented for reusability and scalability.

-Responsive design is handled using flexbox, media queries, and rem-based spacing.

📱 Responsiveness
The design is fully responsive across:

✅ Desktop

✅ Tablet

✅ Mobile

Implemented using CSS media queries and adaptive layout techniques.

✨ Interactive Behaviors
All components include interactive states:

Hover effects on clickable elements.

Active/Selected styles for buttons and toggles.

Focus and keyboard navigability for accessibility.

📝 Assumptions & Notes
Some icons and behaviors are based on best assumptions if not explicitly defined in the design.

Date and time pickers were custom-built based on the design with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.

The sidebar layout was adjusted for consistent vertical spacing and logo alignment.
